# HousePrices-SYS6018-Competition2
Working with Court Haworth and Ni Zhuang

The goal is to accurately predict the prices at which a number of homes will sell based on available data using methods like multilinear regression which we've already learned.

We have chosen roles to work on the project effectively.

Court is working on cleaning and exploring the data to gain insights that might be useful for the model building. 

Ni is working on the Parametric model which is a linear regression model for predicting the house prices.

Adrian is working on the Nonparametric model which is a K Nearest Neighbors regression model for predicting house prices as well.
